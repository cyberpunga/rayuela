Johnny Temple:
Between midnight and dawn, baby we may ever have to part,
But there’s one thing about it, baby, please remember I’ ve always been your heart.
The Yas Yas Girl:
Well it’s blues in my house, from the roof to the ground,
And it’s blues everywhere since my good man left town.
Blues in my mail— box cause I cain’t get no mail,
Says blues in my bread— box ‘cause my bread got stale.
Blues in my meal-barrel and there’s blues upon my shelf
And there’s blues in my bed, ‘cause I’m sleepin’ by myself.
